In this page, you can find all the project I have worked on:

| Project Type | Industry | Description | link |
|------------|----------|-------------|------|
| MLOps | Cross-industry: Manufacturing, Pharmaceutical,....| I am the creator and co-developer of the Microsoft Consulting Service MLOps Solution Accelerator leveraging Azure, which has served as the basis to over 20 projects and increased delivery speed by up to 50%. The project is a 100% open-source.| https://github.com/microsoft/dstoolkit-mlops-base |
| Demand Forecasting | Energy and Logistic | The goal of the project was to create a multi-model approach to forecast the demand for multiple geographical regions and levels (national to city). Leveraging Databricks, I built an pipeline of sequential notebooks to: (1) Prepare the data: inputting erroneous data and ensuring correct temporal train-test split.(2) Multi-model approach: creating a notebook that create a similar automl approach using: Prophet, lstm, and xgboost. (3) Map-reduce orchestrator: to apply the step above to each geographical level, I had to apply the multi-model approach to each level using sparks' map-reduce trick.(4) Output formatting: the forecast had to be aligned to be post-processed based on user requirements. | Similar approach: https://github.com/microsoft/solution-accelerator-many-models |
| Recommender System | Entertainment | The objective was to build the foundation of the recommendation system for their video content. The solution was used to build a generic code repository | repo: https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Synapse-Content-Recommendations-Solution-Accelerator, resources: https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders |
| Team Lead | Cross-industry | For big projects, it happened that I was called for support on the team leadership side. I was responsible for team aligned with Architect team, project manager, and data science team. My activities included progress tracking, sprint planning with the team, and technical design decision taking and stakeholders management. My approach always consists to keep the team up to date and make the individual participate in technical decisions. This means having the right people at the table and empowering peers to own their work and present their results |
