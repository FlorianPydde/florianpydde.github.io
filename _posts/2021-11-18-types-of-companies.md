I often happen to discuss career ideas with colleagues and one topic that always comes up is the type of company to consider when searching for a new position.

I remember back then at university, while I was finishing my Master thesis a colleague of mine asked me: so what's next for you ? At that time, the only thing I knew for sure was that I wanted to pursue a career in data science/machine learning. The hype for this role was growing exponentially and I enjoyed the process of building system leveraging AI. However, I didn't know much about what kind company to search for so I started looking for companies offering a position as a junior data scientist. I knew I didn't want to work in finance or insurance sector and there were little options in the IT sector. Nevertheless, I was attracted by the promise of consulting companies (Mckinsey, BCG, ....) or service departments from top IT companies (Microsoft Services, AWS, etc) that I'd have the chance to work on a wide range of projects and sectors. 
So I started with my journey in the Center of Excellence of Ernst&Young and eventually ended up working for Microsoft Services. Now, with some experience, I wanted to write about how I would approach the job search if I had to start all over again. My reasoning is based on my journey in the Data&AI sector but I believe it can be applied to various professions. Moreover, I have so far only worked in the service sector. Hence, I'd glad to receive different views on the subject. 
In my case, I'd classify every company into three distinct categories: (1) consulting/service companies like Microsoft Consulting Services, Accenture, Mckinsey, etc (2) End clients, i.e. companies whose core business does not rely on data or IT, and (3) Product companies who have develop software products (Facebook, Uber, Expedia, Databricks,  etc).  So let's try to write down the pros and cons of each category.

## Number 1: Services

I will focus only on the tech part of the company. For example, Accenture is a tech consuting company whereas BCG is primarily build around management consulting, but does offer technical services (in their case, the department is called GAMMA).

So what can you expect from these type companies ? You will be able work on a variety of projects, with different customers and in different sectors. In my case, I have worked in serveral sectors like energy, financial, healthcare and working on projects about MLOps, forecasting, nlp, and others topics. Furthermore, you will have the chance to work closely with different roles: business advisors, IT architects, data engineers, UX, etc. In Microsoft Service, I also have the chance to work in pre-sales engagement which can consists in concretising the AI vision of the client, defining the value of their AI ideas, or simply writing the statement of work (basically the contract).  The big advantage of this type of company is that you learn a lot and you learn fast.

So what would be the downsides in this case ? First of all, we will have to differentiate again the type of service company: (1) product providers (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, IBM, SAP, etc), (2) tech consulting or partners of the first category (3) business, management, audit, consulting (Mckinsey, EY, Deloitte, etc). The objective of these companies is to sell but the difference is on HOW they do it.
