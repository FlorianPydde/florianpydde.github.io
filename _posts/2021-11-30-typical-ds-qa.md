## The standard datascience recruiting process

I have done several interviews with different types of companies: startups, consulting organizations, and standard companies. By now, most of them have a standard recruiting process, and you might find them on [*glassdoor*](https://www.glassdoor.es/index.htm) that looks usually like this:

1. HR interview: what are your motivations ? What kind of role are you looking for ? aaaaand (!) What's your expected salary ?
2. General DS knowledge Interview: 1 or 2 rounds of general datascience questions which I will detailed in this post.
3. Manger interview: Personal discussion with your direct manager.

For the more "techy" or companies that are more mature in datascience, you will have to go some extra steps:

4. Programming test: here you will have to show that you know how to use standard libraries like scikit-learn, pandas data manipulation.
5. Business problem solving: you will have some business case presented to you and you will have to try to formulate it into a data science problem and setting the expectations rights (what a model can do or not for instance).
6. (optional) "homework" tasks: you will get a dataset or a problem to solve within some period of times (a few days or a week) and present your results.

On may note that there are other factors that will add vary the level of difficulty/complexity of process as, for instance, the level or seniority (entry, senior, ....), how specific the role is (researcher, deeplearning engineer, MLOps engineer, ....). Even though the process could look differently depending on the position, there are very typical DS questions.
